This is Joe's own editor, which doesn't happen to have a conda package.
This is Tom's preferred editor, so we want to install this as part of afids.

Note that the default joe editor internally does funny (but perfectly legal)
things with it's hard coded path to the joerc file. We have a patch that
rearranges this slightly in a way that conda can support updating the path
when it installs. Without this patch, a conda install can't find its joerc file.
