# If you are using Conda (e.g., doing "conda activate <env>") you do
# *not* need to run this setup file. This is here for software that
# lives outside of conda which may want to use the afids data. The
# automatically run Conda script
# $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/afids-data-activate.sh already
# handles the setup.
