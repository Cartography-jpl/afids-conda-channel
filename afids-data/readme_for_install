This contains various support data files for use with geocal and AFIDS.

Note that some of the data is very large (e.g. srtmL2_filled is 600 GB). We
don't distribute this data as Conda packages because it is too large. Normally
this is copied somewhere on the system.

You can either replace the directories here with symbolic links to where the
data is actually located, or you can update the environment variables set in
$CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/afids-data-activate.sh with the true
location of the data.

Note there is a setup_afids_data.sh script in this directory. If you are
using Conda (e.g., doing "conda activate <env>") you do *not* need to run
this setup file. This is there for software that lives outside of conda which
may want to use the afids data. The automatically run Conda script
$CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/afids-data-activate.sh already handles
the setup.
