There is nothing special about this gdal build. It is just that the one
in conda-forge depends on a number of packages that conflict with other
packages. So we build our own version to use a compatible set of dependencies.

This is pretty much a copy of gdal-feedstock
(https://github.com/conda-forge/gdal-feedstock), with minor editting for
turning of some dependencies that clash
